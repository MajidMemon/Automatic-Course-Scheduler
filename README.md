Automatic Course Scheduler using Genetic Algorithm
This project is an implementation of an automatic course scheduler using a genetic algorithm. It utilizes Python with the Django framework for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the scheduling of courses, instructors, classrooms, and meeting times.

Technologies Used
Python 3.11.5
Django 4.2.6
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Visual Studio Code (IDE)
How it Works
Input Data: The system allows administrators to input data such as instructors, classrooms, courses, departments, sections, and meeting times using Django forms.
Genetic Algorithm: Upon receiving input data, the genetic algorithm runs in the backend to generate an optimized course schedule based on various constraints and preferences.
User Interface: Administrators can interact with the system through a web interface where they can input data, trigger the genetic algorithm, and view the generated course schedule.
Authentication: The system provides authentication functionalities for administrators. Administrators have access to administrative panels for managing users and data.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Python 3.11.5 and Django 4.2.6.
Set up your development environment using Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE.
Run the Django server and access the web interface through your browser.
Input data using the provided forms, trigger the genetic algorithm, and view the generated course schedule.
Administrators can manage users and data through the administrative panels.
